I nur. examined with some attention the sheets of a
Life of Washington, in Latin, by Francis Glass, A. Μ.,
and I consider the work a performance of no small merit.
In regard to the style of composition, the writer has suc-
ceeded far beyond the ordinary efforts at writing in Latin.
The idiom is remarkably pure, the words being selected
with careful attention to precision and classic use. The
barbarisms which the introduction of modern institutione
and observances, particularly the science of war, and
legislation, must necessarily compel the writer to use,
are so skilsully reduced to the forms of Roman declen-
sion, that they are not, in general, offensive. Many of
them are words exceedingly sonorous and descriptive.
Another difficulty of no small importance in writing Lat·
in is, the proper use of ‘⁴ equivalents,” arising from the
circumstance, that of the numerous classes of words
which our language has borrowed from that, the greater
portion of them have now a meaning different from the
origina13 and the use of these words in the same sense
which is annexed to the' analogous English terma, would
be a barbarousqperversion of their meaning, offensive to
purity and good taste. In avoiding these, the writer of
this work shows accurate and faithful training. But he
has not merely freedom from faults3 he possesses posi-
tive excellences. In his periodS, he has generally the
flow and gracesul variety which are the principal charm
of the style of history, exhibiting much of ancient digni-
ty and simplicity, and occasionally turning them with un-
common elegance. In description he is not deficient in
strength and energy, but is easy, and sufficiently difflue
to avoid the meagerness of a mere annalist. The life os
the venerated Father of our Country‚ a character so fun
of moral and intellectual grandeur, can be delineated in
no so appropriate diction as in the severe and majestic
simplicity of the Roman. And the youthful student of
classic enthusiasm will find the history of his beloved
country invested with a chan-ming interest, when he meets
