APPENDIX.

[The following peges contuiti the views of our author relative to
the beet mode of teeehing the ancient langueges. They were
incorporated by himin his Life of Washingwn, but will find, the
editor conceivee, a more appropriate place in an Appendiz]

Acanmners et Tironibus, in hisce civitatibus
-nostris foederatis Americanis, eis, praesertirn', qui in
ludis¹ literariis operam navant, Salutem in Do-
mino sempiternam. Vobis, lectores candidissimi,
illustrissimi Washingtonii vitam, latinitate dona-
-tam, Americanorum omnium primus, offerre et
exhibere gestio. Operae pretium facturus videor,
si de linguas docendi vera ratione paucis disseram.
Doctorum plureS, me, tali in re, operam et tempus
deperdere, proculdubie, existimabunt: quod si,
hi viri, forte reputaverint, quam difficile sit, Grae..
cam et Romanam linguas ad amussim callere,¹²

 

1 Ludis, ᾦα, “ schools ;” the noun ludus is used for a school, by
the best authors: by ludus-literarium is meant, a college, or, perhaps,
rather, a grammar-school.

Ω callere, “ to know perfeetly,” ( according· to mle) the Greek and
Roman languages: the verb calleo is used by Horace in this sense3
“ Legat-mumque sonum digitis callemus et aare„ “And we under·
stand a leg-ilintate sauna by our finger-5, and ear ,·” which good classic

scholare can do even at thi- day. An inaccurate pronunciation of
Greek and Latin should be avoided.
