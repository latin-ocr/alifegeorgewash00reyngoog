against the learned tongues which seems blowing into
life in certain parts os the Union. Let but the lives of
our distinguished men, and the thrilling soenes in which

. they played a part, be embalmed in the noble languages

of antiquity—let the associations os patriotic story be
linked in the mind of the young student with the medium
in which it is here conveyed‚ and the classics will be so
intrenched in the affections of the rising generation, that
no new-fangled systems, however backed by popular
