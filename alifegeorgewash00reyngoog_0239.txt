From Clam-les Anthou, LL. D., Jay- Professor os -Lan- -
ξέῖἷξῑῖ Οοῖιιίηόἰα College, and Rector of tlte Gramma&- ¹

Ar the request of- Mr. Reynolds,1 have examined the
manuscript of a Latin Biography of Wasliington, ·by the

late Mr. Glass‚ of 01110, and consider it well worthy of ’ .

publication· ,·1t is, indeed, quite a curiosity of its kind.
There is generally 'an air of stiffness ιιι the productioris
of modern Latinists‚ which soon betrays a want o‘f fa-
miliarity, on the 'part of the writer, with the idiom em-·

ployed by him. Nothing of this nature is to be discov- , ,

ere'd in the present work3 on the contrary, the most cur-
sory ‘reader cannot fail to be struck with the easy flow ,

of the style, and the graceful turn of very many. of the peri- ·

eds.- The care, too, which h'as been exercised ιιι the se-
lection of appropriate terius and phrases is worthy of
notice, especially when taken ιιι connexion with the fact· Ι.

of the author’ s having written. his work without the aid ¹

of any books of reference, and his having been compe1-·
led, consequently, to rely solely on the stores· ·of his own
memory.1: would not ¹wish to be understood. [as viewing
this productiori in the light of an accurately, critical and
finished piece, but yet 1 cannot help thinkilrg that it will ,
make a very good school· book.- For the subject will ιιι- ,

terest 'the young scholar, and awaken the best feelings 1n ·

· his bosom; while, if the' Latinity of the work should at
any time appear to the instructer of a questionable or er ·
roneous character, he‘ can consult the improvement of “
his pupils, and at the same time display his own acumen,
in suggesting other and better expressions.
