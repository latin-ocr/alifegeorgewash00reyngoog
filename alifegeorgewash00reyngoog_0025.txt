Vernon, and the delineation of the character of
Washington, the most rigid critic will find much
to commend. The notes speak for themselves.
The author evidently had in view the possibility
of his work being introduced into schooIS, and
they were therefore written for the benefit‚ prin-
cipally, of the younger class of readerS, though,
occasionally, they assume a higher and graver
character.

In conclusion, the editor entertains the hope,
that the little work which is here offered to the
literati of his country, will be kindly received by
them, and be found not undeserving of their notice.
It is the production of a poor and almost friend-
less individual, whom a sound and liberal educa-
tion had fitted for higher pursuitS, but ·whom mis-
fortune and disappointment had driven from the
scenes of his earlier yearS, to the more congenial
solitudes of the West. And it will show the power-
ful influence that classical studies, when properly
pursued, are calculated to exercise over the mind3
how they cling to it, even amid missortune, and

impert a sure solace under all the ills of life.
