From the Rev. S. B. Wylie, D. D„ Professor qs Ancient
affige& and Viae Provost os the University qs Penn-

ΜΒ. Ram-ronne,

Dua Sua—Iu compliance with your request, Ι have
examined ‘⁴ A Life of Washington, in Latin Prose, by
Francis GJass, A. Μ., of Ohio.” My opinion of this per—
sor-mance is, that 111 purity of style, rotundity os period,
and Judicious selection of words, it 13 exceeded by none
of the modern works introductory to the study of the
ancient Roman classice. Its imperfectione are few3 its
beauties numerous, It will be a valuable acquisition to
our 013331031 30110013, initiatory to Caesar or Nepos, or
such first Roman author as the teacher may see 031130 to
adopt. Such an American book 1133 hitherto been a de-
sideratum. It is now furnished. It 13 well calculated
to 111-0 the youthful gemae, and inspire the generous mind
w'ith the purest patriotic sentiments.

In thus expressing myself‚ Ι cannot help mingling
some feeling with my recollectione of the author: I was
acquainted with Mr. Glass from 1113 boyish days. He
was an enthusiastic votary of the classic muse immedi-
ately on 1113 initiation into the Grammar School. That
he laboured notin vain, this production will be a lasting
memorial.

Very respectfully‚ 3101113, dcc„

S. B. WYLI'E.

Dua ἓως-Ι Heartily agree with the above recommen-
dation, and add, that Ι will introduce the book into the

Academy under my care as soon 33 published.
