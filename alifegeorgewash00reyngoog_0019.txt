he had pursued the business of school-keeping,
in various places, where a teacher was wanted,
subject to the whims of children and the caprices
of their parents, enough alone to¹ disturb the great·

.world, the most difficult is that of an instructor,
who has to chastise idle boys, and to satisfy
ignorant parents. Every new change of school
district gave Glass some new cause os suffering,
which had an effect on his health and temper.

During all the time he had been in the western
country, he had made but little or no progress in
his contemplated work. In the drudgery of a
daily school, he could not think of sitting down to
such a labor; he wanted retirement and tranquil-
lity, while engaged in writing, to do justice to
himself and the subject. He would often discover
the despest sensibility‚ when any allusion was
made to the deeds or fame of Washington; and
his own contemplatione on the wishes of his heart,
seemed to break down all the energies of his· mind,
and unfit him for the common duties os life. He
was conscious of his weakneSS, but he had not
sufficient energy of mind to rise superior to it.
Every day his missortunes were making inroads
upon his slender form, and hurrying him to the
grave. He viewed his situation without dismay,
only fearing that he should die before he had
written the life of Washington.
